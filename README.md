# Neptune
**A fast lightweight package manager written in Python.**


## Beta
This is currently in Beta, Tucana's main package manager is still going to be mercury until the next stable release, however anything using mercury is going to be transitioning to Neptune effective immediately 

## Features
-- Near-Instant dependency resolution (compared to the multiple seconds on mercury)  
-- Installation of packages  
-- Removal of Packages  
-- Syncing with repositories (Multi-Repo Support)  
-- Automatic Version Selecting  
-- Safe Updating with non-overwrite logic  

# Difference?
Neptune is designed to be extremely developer friendly and modifiable. It purposefully does not use things like a SQL database, instead opting for a file-based approach, to make it easier to make new packages and host your own repository.
